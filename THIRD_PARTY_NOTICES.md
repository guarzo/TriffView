## Alert Sounds

- Files: `native/Assets/sounds/*.wav`, built from the sources in `assets-src/alert-sounds/`
- Used by: TriffView alert playback

- License: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) — https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

Sounds from notificationsounds.com. **These sounds have been modified.** Each was trimmed to
remove encoder lead-in and inaudible tail, converted to 16-bit mono WAV, and peak-normalised to
-3 dBFS with 5 ms edge fades. `scripts/build-alert-sounds.py` performs the modification and
documents it; the unmodified sources are kept in `assets-src/alert-sounds/` so the change is
inspectable.

| Shipped as | Source sound | Source page |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bell.wav` | Sly | https://notificationsounds.com/application-user-interface-ui-sounds/sly-user-interface-sound |
| `ding.wav` | Come here | https://notificationsounds.com/notification-sounds/come-here-notification |
| `chime.wav` | That was quick | https://notificationsounds.com/message-tones/that-was-quick-606 |
| `pulse.wav` | No problem | https://notificationsounds.com/free-jingles-and-logos/no-problem-notification-sound |

The shipped file names are historical ids rather than descriptions — they were kept unchanged so
that existing users' saved sound choices did not need migrating.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE
Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts,
including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed
and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used
by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released
under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under
this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or
their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS

Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may include
source files, build scripts and documentation.
